## My portfolio

This app is designed to show off my skills as a web developer as well as an introduction to who I am.

To continue into the page click on the get to know more.

This brings you to the about page which has an introduction to my background and what my interests are. 

Using the nav bar at the top you can navigate to a page displaying my projects or you can click to my contact information.

Projects are listed with a picture background and include links to the repositories and their live deployed location.
Also included is a brief description of what the app does.

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

Create a new empty repository without a README 
clone the repository as a remote origin branch.
Do a push into the remote master.
In the console run an npm deploy.
This should create a new branch called -gh-pages.
It should now be live!
